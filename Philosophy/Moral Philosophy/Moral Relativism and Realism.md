## Moral Relativism
Moral relativism is the belief that moral judgments are only valid within specific viewpoints and that no viewpoint holds absolute privilege. It is often associated with the idea that different cultures exhibit vastly different moral values, denying the existence of universal moral values shared by all human societies. Proponents of moral relativism argue against passing moral judgments on practices and beliefs from cultures other than one's own.

The roots of relativistic moral views can be traced back to ancient Greece in the 5th century B.C.E., and they remained prominent until the 19th and 20th centuries. Several factors contributed to the rise of moral relativism during this period, including an increased awareness of cultural diversity through anthropological discoveries, a decline in the influence of religion in modernized societies, a critical stance towards colonialism and its assumptions of moral superiority, and growing skepticism towards any form of moral objectivity due to the difficulty in proving value judgments.

For some, moral relativism follows logically from cognitive relativism, which extends relativism to the truth in general. However, many moral relativists consider the fact-value distinction to be fundamental. One reason for embracing moral relativism is the perceived impracticality of moral objectivism, as attempts to establish a single, universally valid set of moral principles face substantial challenges. Some defend moral relativism by arguing that it fosters tolerance and encourages understanding of other cultures on their own terms.

Critics argue that relativists often overstate the diversity among cultures, as underlying shared principles might exist beneath surface differences. Some contend that a core set of universal values is necessary for any human culture to thrive. Additionally, critics accuse relativists of inconsistency, pointing out that they reject universal moral norms while invoking the principle of tolerance as a universal norm. The most significant objection to moral relativism, according to critics, is that it can lead to the dangerous notion that "anything goes." For instance, slavery might be deemed acceptable within the norms of a slave society, and sexist practices justified based on the values of a sexist culture, without a non-relative standard for assessment. Critics argue that without a non-relativistic foundation, we lack a basis for making critical moral appraisals of our own culture's conventions or for judging one society as better than another. However, most moral relativists typically reject the assumption that such judgments require a non-relativistic basis.

### Clarifying What Moral Relativism Is (and Is Not)
Defining moral relativism proves challenging due to varying interpretations from different writers. Both proponents and critics of relativism offer distinct characterizations of the concept. Thus, it is crucial to clarify some of the positions linked to moral relativism before crafting a definition that encapsulates its main ideas as advocated by its adherents.
#### Descriptive Relativism
Descriptive relativism is a perspective that deals with the diversity found in different cultures. **It asserts that moral beliefs and practices vary among societies and sometimes even within different groups within a single society**. For instance, while some societies condemn homosexuality, others accept it, and in certain cultures, correcting a teacher as a student might be seen as disrespectful, while in others, it may be encouraged.

As an empirical claim supported by anthropological research, descriptive relativism is closely associated with anthropologists like William Sumner, Ruth Benedict, and Meville Herskovits. This thesis exists on a spectrum, with its strongest and most controversial form denying the existence of any moral universals—norms or values endorsed by every human culture. However, this extreme view is seldom defended, as it appears reasonable to assume that certain values, such as caring for the wellbeing of the young, are essential for a society's survival. Benedict seems to approach this extreme view when describing three societies in Patterns of Culture, arguing that their distinct orientations and pursuits make them incommensurable and not subject to judgment based on each other's standards.

**In its weakest and least controversial form, descriptive relativism merely refutes the idea that all cultures share the same moral outlook.** A well-known version defended by David Wong is called "pluralistic relativism." However, the simplistic approach of descriptive relativism, which takes any differences in moral beliefs as evidence of differing moral outlooks between cultures, has faced criticism from both social scientists like Solomon Asch and philosophers like Michele Moody-Adams. **They argue that it is challenging to establish relativist claims about moral diversity without introducing bias or overlooking internal conflicts and cultural changes.** Additionally, many apparent moral differences between cultures might not be fundamental disagreements about questions of value, but rather differences in factual beliefs leading to divergent views on certain behaviors, such as the case of homosexuality and its perceived consequences.

Given these challenges, contemporary defenders of descriptive relativism often embrace a more modest and nuanced version of the doctrine. Wong, for example, posits that human nature and the human condition place limits on how much moral systems can diverge while still being considered valid moralities. Nevertheless, he argues that "moral ambivalence," where individuals disagree on moral views but recognize the reasonableness of each other's positions, is common and typically arises when they prioritize shared values differently.

#### Cultural Relativism
Cultural relativism is a foundational principle in modern anthropology, asserting that the beliefs and practices of human beings must be understood within the context of their respective cultures. This view was championed by anthropologists like Sumner and Boas, who aimed to counter unconscious ethnocentrism that could lead social scientists to misinterpret observed phenomena. An example of this is the ritualistic infliction of pain, which might initially appear to be a punishment aimed at deterring wrongdoing, but could actually serve a completely different purpose, such as cleansing the community of impurity.

Interestingly, this emphasis on "situational meanings" has been used to critique descriptive relativism. For instance, psychologist Karl Duncker argued that an Eskimo killing an aged parent, socially accepted as a means to spare suffering, should not be equated with killing a parent in a society where such an act would be considered murder. The implication is that the meaning behind each act differs, and as a result, we should not automatically assume conflicting values between the two societies.

In a broader sense, cultural relativism also denotes a methodological principle for social scientists. To uphold scientific rigor, they should carefully describe and analyze the cultural practices they study, avoiding any normative judgment on what they observe. This approach ensures a more objective and unbiased understanding of the cultures under investigation.
#### Ethical Non-Realism
Ethical non-realism posits that there is no objective moral order that renders moral beliefs true or false and actions right or wrong. Ethical realists, in contrast, believe that moral statements have objective truth values independent of human perspectives and norms prevailing in societies. Leading philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill, and Moore have historically embraced ethical realism, and contemporary defenders include Nagel, McDowell, and Boyd.

Ethical non-realists reject ethical realism but do so for various reasons, leading to different forms of non-realism. The most straightforward rejection is seen in moral error theory, advocated by Mackie, which claims that all moral claims are false due to their positing of ontologically peculiar properties not empirically detectable. A more tentative skepticism towards moral realism is found in Hume's view, which denies the possibility of proving moral statements through reason or empirical evidence, asserting that moral views are grounded in feelings. Ruse and Sinnott-Armstrong have presented updated versions of this skepticism, arguing that certain moral beliefs are evolutionarily conditioned and not rationally justified.

Ethical non-realism aligns with moral relativism in many cases, but they are not synonymous. While ethical non-realism denies an objective foundation for morality, moral relativism goes further by asserting that moral claims may be true or false relative to specific standpoints, such as a particular culture or historical period. However, non-realism does not automatically imply relativism, as individuals may deny objective morality without embracing the idea that moral truths depend on subjective perspectives.

#### Ethical Non-Cognitivism
Ethical non-cognitivism asserts that moral judgments lack truth-value as they are not of the type that can be true or false. Instead, they resemble expressions of feelings or commands rather than factual statements. Expressivism, a prevalent form of ethical non-cognitivism in the twentieth century, considers moral statements as conveying evaluative attitudes. Emotivism, a significant version of expressivism, suggests that moral judgments express the speaker's feelings toward the subject being judged. For example, saying "Nelson Mandela is a good man" signifies approval of Mandela, akin to exclaiming "Hurrah for Mandela!"

Prescriptivism, another form of ethical non-cognitivism developed by R. M. Hare, acknowledges that moral statements can express emotional attitudes but emphasizes their primary purpose as prescribing certain behaviors. For instance, "stealing is wrong" conveys the command "Don't steal!" More recent versions of expressivism, like Simon Blackburn's "quasi-realism," maintain that although moral claims are not strictly true or false, we can still treat them as if they are true in our ethical reasoning and practices.

While ethical non-cognitivism and moral relativism both stem from acknowledging a fact-value gap, they differ in their treatment of moral claims' truth status. Ethical non-cognitivism denies that moral claims can be true or false, seeing them as expressions of attitudes or commands. On the other hand, moral relativism does not deny the possibility of moral claims being true but rather rejects the existence of an objective, universally applicable moral order. It allows moral claims to be true in a more modest, relativistic sense, relative to specific cultural perspectives.

#### Meta-Ethical Relativism
Meta-ethical relativism asserts that moral judgments lack absolute truth or falsehood and are only true relative to specific standpoints. This relativity is crucial to various versions of moral relativism, preventing the contradiction of a sentence being both true and false simultaneously. Just like two people can say "It is raining" and "It is not raining" from different locations, moral claims can vary in truth depending on the normative framework they reference.

The relativity of moral claims to standpoints should not be confused with situational relativity, as circumstances can indeed impact our evaluation of moral judgments. Some meta-ethical relativists focus on justifying moral judgments based on the prevailing norms of a community, arguing that feelings of moral obligation arise from being embedded in specific social groups sharing similar moral outlooks.

While many moral relativists embrace some form of meta-ethical relativism, it is not equivalent to full-fledged moral relativism. One can adopt meta-ethical relativism and still argue that one standpoint is objectively superior to others. The denial of the possibility of demonstrably superior standpoints distinguishes moral relativism with its more radical nature and attracts considerable criticism.

#### Normative Relativism
Normative relativism holds that it is wrong to judge or interfere with the moral beliefs and practices of cultures operating with different moral frameworks from one's own. This position, advocated by anthropologists to counter ethnocentrism during the colonial era, promotes tolerance and respect for diverse cultural norms. It suggests that each society should be judged based on its own norms and values. Some argue that normative relativism is a consequence of moral relativism, but others contend that it requires additional principles, like liberal political theory, to support a non-interventionist stance. The relationship between meta-ethical relativism (a position about the nature of morality) and normative relativism (a prescriptive stance) remains a subject of debate among scholars.

#### Moral Relativism
Moral relativism encompasses various perspectives, making it challenging to define it concisely. However, a commonly endorsed position by those who identify as moral relativists can be outlined as follows:

1. Moral judgments and the evaluation of actions are only true or false relative to specific standpoints, often the moral framework of a particular community or culture.

2. No standpoint can be objectively proven as superior to another in terms of moral correctness.

For instance, the statement "slavery is unjust" may be true according to the moral perspective of most contemporary Norwegians but false from the viewpoint of white Americans in 18th-century South Carolina. Moral philosophers throughout history have attempted to establish the objective correctness and superiority of certain moral outlooks, relying on God's will, metaphysical moral orders, Reason, intuitions, or human nature's needs. However, the moral relativist rejects these attempts as they rely on premises linked to the standpoint being defended and may not be accepted by those who do not share that perspective.

Although moral relativism suggests that one moral outlook cannot be definitively proven superior to another, it does not negate the possibility of making judgments or offering reasons for preferring one outlook over another. Gilbert Harman acknowledges that he can adhere to basic liberal moral principles while recognizing that his reasons may not be convincing to someone from a different moral culture. Similarly, David Wong, a moderate moral relativist, argues that some moralities can be considered better as they better serve universal human needs and purposes. However, significant variations in moral outlooks can exist within the constraints of shared human conditions, making it difficult to appeal to neutral criteria of superiority.

Moral relativists often contextualize the truth of moral judgments within cultures, which could encompass entire societies, historical periods, or even subcultures within a society. While the standpoint could theoretically be narrowed to an individual's perspective, making it a form of moral subjectivism, this is not widely embraced, as it risks reducing morality to a mere reflection of individual beliefs without any objective foundation. Overall, moral relativism remains a complex and debated philosophical position due to its varied interpretations and implications. 

## Arguments for Moral Relativism
The primary arguments supporting moral relativism do not necessarily align seamlessly with each other. Some relativists assert that value judgments are inherently distinct from factual judgments, the latter being capable of objective truth, while the former are not. On the other hand, there are those who view the truth of both types of judgments as inherently relative to a particular conceptual or cultural framework. Therefore, the arguments put forth in favor of moral relativism present diverse paths through which one may adopt a relativistic perspective on morality.
####  The Argument from Cultural Diversity

The argument for moral relativism is more complex than simply pointing out the existence of diverse moral belief systems in different cultures. Instead, the awareness of such diversity challenges the idea of a single true morality and encourages the view that one's own culture's morality is not inherently superior but merely one among many moral systems.

Moral diversity, in itself, does not logically lead to moral relativism or disprove moral objectivism. Just as diverse views on the origins of humanity do not invalidate the possibility of a single correct account, moral diversity does not necessarily negate the existence of an objective moral truth. Moreover, moral relativism does not satisfactorily explain the diversity of moral systems since the absence of an objective truth cannot account for the phenomenon. The argument that cultures would have converged on an objective moral truth if it existed is flawed, as the absence of such a truth merely makes diversity more likely, similar to how different cultures have varied sporting preferences without necessitating a single, objectively superior game.

While moral relativism may be excused from explaining the lack of a single moral code, objectivists must provide an explanation for why various cultures seem to have failed to discover the one true moral code. Explanations such as ignorance, tradition, fear, and self-interest may be offered to address this issue.

Despite its limitations, moral diversity is seen as suggestive by relativists, who draw parallels between moralities and religions. The existence of numerous religions does not prove that none of them could be the one true religion, but it does raise the question of how the objective truth of any religion or morality can be demonstrated. Similarly, relativists question how one could prove the superiority of one morality over all others given the diversity of moral belief systems across cultures.
#### The Untenability of Moral Objectivism
The second argument for Moral Relativism, which is the most popular and persuasive justification for relativism, is that the Moral objectivism is insufficient, and discredited. This is followed from the collapse of moral objectivism. In its oldest and widespread form, moral objectives are valid because of some divine sanction. With the decline in religious faith, this foundation for morality was shaken, Therefore much moral philosophy from the 17th century onwards were looking for an alternative to objectivism.  

Despite the efforts of Kant, Mill, and their successors, many remain skeptical about the possibility of proving the objective truth or the universal validity of moral claims. **The fact that the moral objectivists themselves cannot agree about which moral system is correct, or what its philosophical foundation should be, encourages this skepticism. But it also rests on forceful philosophical considerations.** If one accepts that value judgements are logically distinct from factual statements and cannot be derived from them, then any attempt to justify a moral claim must rest on at least some value-laden premises. And these basic moral presuppositions will not be susceptible to proof at all.

The increase in skepticism towards moral objectivism is one of the most significant shifts in the history of moral philosophy. Unlike science, which is generally describes an independently existing, objective reality; Ethics and moral values are not converging among scientists in different cultures and belief systems. Thus it seems hard to find the common ground, with which one would be able to establish a moral objectivism.

Moral relativism is not the only response to the perceived problems with moral objectivism.  As noted earlier, ethical non-realism, ethical non-cognitivism, emotivism, moral subjectivism, and moral skepticism are other possible responses, for the mere denial of objectivism, like the mere fact of cultural diversity, does not logically entail moral relativism.  It does, however, undoubtedly make people more receptive to a relativistic outlook.

#### The Argument from Cognitive Relativism
The majority of moral relativists do not embrace cognitive relativism, which offers a relativistic account of truth in general, not just the truth of moral judgments. However, some do, and this is another path to moral relativism. he philosophically interesting claim at the heart of most forms of moral relativism is that moral statements are true (or false) relative to some normative standpoint, usually one characteristic of some particular culture.  But what does “true relative to” mean, precisely? 

From an objectivist or realist point of view, the phrase makes little sense since what determines the truth or falsity of a statement is whether or not it accords with objective reality.  The cognitive relativist, however, argues that this notion of truth is philosophically vacuous since it employs the notion of an independent, objective reality that lies beyond any possible experience.

Cognitive relativism holds that (a) the truth value of any judgment is relative to some particular standpoint (for example, a conceptual scheme or theoretical framework); and (b) no standpoint is metaphysically privileged over all others—there is no “God’s eye point of view” that yields the objective truth about reality.  Relativists of this sort are not so impressed by the fact-value distinction.  They do not view truth as a property that sentences possess in virtue of their correspondence to an independent reality.  Rather, they argue that we call a sentence “true” when it coheres with the rest of our beliefs, perceptions, values, and assumptions—in other words, when it is rationally acceptable or appears justified according to our general conceptual scheme.  On this view, “the earth moves around the sun” is false relative to a medieval conceptual scheme and is true relative to ours.  Similarly, “homosexuality is morally wrong” is true relative to the perspective of conservative Christians and false relative to that of twenty-first century liberals.  There is no essential difference between the two cases.  And in both cases, it is not possible to demonstrate logically the superiority of one standpoint over the other.

#### Moral Relativism Promotes Tolerance
The idea that moral relativism promotes tolerance is a normative argument.   The key idea is that moral relativism encourages a certain humility.  Becoming aware of the merely relative validity of one’s own moral norms makes one less likely to fall into arrogant ethnocentrism and less inclined to pass moral judgment on the beliefs and practices found in other cultures.  In effect, the argument is that moral relativism entails normative relativism (see above).  Ruth Benedict states the idea forcefully at the end of her influential work _Patterns of Culture_, when she expresses her hope that, on the basis of the sort of anthropological research she has described, “we shall arrive at a more realistic social faith, accepting as grounds of hope and as new bases for tolerance the coexisting and equally valid patterns of life which mankind has created for itself from the raw materials of existence” (_Patterns of Culture_, p. 257). Benedict, in fact, takes the argument a step further, arguing that the relativistic outlook she champions can be positively beneficial in helping to combat bigotry, racism, chauvinism and other forms of prejudice.

One reason for thinking that a relativistic view of morality might foster tolerance is that it will also incline us to be more self-critical.  Edvard Westermarck makes this connection in his 1932 work _Ethical Relativity_ when he says, “Could it be brought home to people that there is no absolute standard in morality, they would perhaps be on the one hand more tolerant and on the other more critical in their judgments” (_Ethical Relativity_, p. 59).  As mentioned earlier, however, even some thinkers sympathetic to relativism, such as Harrison and Wong, are suspicious of the claim that moral relativism by itself necessarily entails a tolerant attitude toward alternative moralities. And critics of relativism, such as W.T. Stace and Karl Popper, argue that if relativism does indeed imply universal tolerance, that this constitutes an objection to it, since some things—like oppressively intolerant moral systems—should not be tolerated.

## Summary of key points relating to staff research

- Making the best choice isn’t always about trying to get to the best possible outcome, it’s sometimes also about trying to minimise the chances of something disastrous happening.

- When we talk about how things ‘ought’ to be we are using such propositions to think more clearly about what to do, think or feel, rather than making descriptive claims about the world around us.

- Even though peoples’ moral judgements express their own personal opinion, we can still identify uncontroversial presuppositions and motivations in their statements that allow us to make neutral observations about moral discourse.


## Relevant research

In his book The Meaning of Ought (2015), Matthew Chrisman discusses the metaethical difficulties surrounding how we think about moral statements and how these relate to other statements made about the world. In the lecture, he makes a distinction between objectivism (that claim that we are describing objective facts when we make moral judgements), relativism (the claim that we are describing cultural or relative practices when we make moral judgements), and emotivism (the claim that we are expressing our emotive reactions when we make moral judgments). In the book, Chrisman argues that the semantics of ‘ought’ allow us to synthesise all three of these claims, resulting in a view that is better able to explain and motivate the intuitions leading to each of them. In the lecture, he uses the example “grass is green” verses “stealing is wrong”. Although these statements fall into the respective categories seen in the lecture of ‘empirical’ versus ‘moral’ judgements, Chrisman points out in his book that both receive similar treatment in compositional semantics. So, instead of treating these statements as belonging to two isolated domains, Chrisman claims we should use the same framework of discussion for both. Consequently, in his book Chrisman argues that ‘ought’ in our language is not used to describe how things really are, but instead is used as a tool to help us think more clearly about what to do, think or feel.

In “Hybrid Views in Meta-ethics” (2014), Guy Fletcher discusses how we can break down moral statements that people make so that we can work out “an uncontroversial, theory-neutral observation” from their words. In the lecture, subjectivist views were presented as those that are relative to each person. In a hybrid theory like that which Fletcher suggests, there is an opportunity to draw non-relative statements out of someone’s subjective views. Fletcher proposes that moral statements rely on presupposed propositions, and that identifying these allows us to work out attitudes that a speaker is expressing. For example, if someone says “tax avoidance is wrong”, we can break down the sentence to identify their presupposition that “some behaviours are wrong” and therefore also claim that ‘the speaker cares about morality’. Fletcher’s paper explores ways in which we can find plausible connections between moral judgements and motivation, allowing statements that appear to be very relative to the person saying them to be understood in a neutral and uncontroversial way.
